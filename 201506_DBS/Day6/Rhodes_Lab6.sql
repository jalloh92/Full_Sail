-- ************* QUESTION 1: *************
-- Select the average mpg city and the average fuel cost annually, grouped by fuel type. 
-- Return the rows with the best mpg city first. 
select fuelType, avg(mpgCity), avg(fuelCostAnnual)
from vehicle
group by fuelType 
order by avg(mpgCity) desc;

-- ************* QUESTION 2: *************
-- Delete the vehicles (Yes, actually delete the rows!) with only 3 cylinders. 
-- Remember, to comply with your foreign key constraints, you must delete from user vehicle first. 
delete from userVehicle where vehicleId in 
(select vehicleId from vehicle where cylinders = 3);

delete from vehicle where cylinders = 3;

-- ************* QUESTION 3: *************
-- Create a function that accepts an item Id as input and returns the number of items in stock.

	declare r int;
	SELECT quantityInStock into r FROM item WHERE itemId = fId;
	return(r);
END$$

-- ************* QUESTION 4: *************
-- Create a function that accepts an order Id as input and returns the sum total price of all items on that order multiplied by the quantity ordered.

CREATE FUNCTION totalPrice(oId INT(11)) 
RETURNS DECIMAL(10,2)

	join item on item.itemId = orderItem.itemId
	WHERE orderId = oId;
	return(r);
END$$

-- ****** test logic **********	
-- This gives me the subtotal (qty * itemPrice) for each itemId in each order
SELECT orderId, orderItem.itemId, quantity, itemPrice, (quantity * itemPrice) as subtotal
from orderItem
join item on item.itemId = orderItem.itemId

-- This gives me the total for each order (sum up qty * itemPrice for each item)
SELECT orderId, SUM(quantity * itemPrice) as total
from orderItem
join item on item.itemId = orderItem.itemId
group by orderId
order by orderId;	

-- ************* QUESTION 5: *************
-- Create a stored procedure that accepts a user Id and returns the userâ€™s full name, 
-- occupation, the count to all orders they placed, the number of DVDs they own, and the number of vehicles they own.
