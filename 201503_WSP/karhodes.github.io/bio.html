<h1>Professional History</h1>
<p>My first career was with Sandia National Labs for 12 years where I was a mechanical engineer / project manager for weapons development projects.  I realized I wanted to transition to a career where I could still be technical, but also creative.  Web Design and Development has been a perfect fit!</p>

<h1>Personal Stuff</h1>
<p>There's a lot I'm passionate about when I'm not coding!  Running, cats, craft beer, crafting and cooking are just a few of my hobbies.</p>
