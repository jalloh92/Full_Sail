<p>Tonight's assignment:  write about a figure in the Web Design / Development world.  I specifically wanted to look up a woman in this field.  My previous job (engineering) was a very male-dominated field and I know that going into web, I'll probably experience the same male \ female ratio.  It's always nice when you are the minority in a field to have someone with a similar perspective to look up to and follow.</p>

<p>I chose Kristina Halvorson.  She is THE person for content strategy.  She's been published in A List Apart and is CEO of her own business.  Her book, Content Strategy for the Web, published in 2009, was the first to address the topic.  She's given talks at the important tech conferences including An Event Apart and SXSW.</p>

<p>I'm personally becoming more and more interested in content strategy and UX as I progress through this program.  It's not just about the code, or making something look pretty, but it's the entire package, the entire message.  How does a site communicate with the humans on the other end?</p>

<p>There's many ways for me to keep up with Kristina.  She has a podcast (Content Talks), twitter account (@halvorson), and LinkedIn account (no public facebook or blog that I could easily find).  I'll definitely be following her and hope to see her speak live one day!</p>
