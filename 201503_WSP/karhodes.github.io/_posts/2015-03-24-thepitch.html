<p>This past week, I presented my status on my project to the class.  While not visible on the site I presented, I had actually done a lot of research on my client and his competition since it has been difficult to readily acquire assets from my client.  Most of my time before my pitch was spent on pulling photos from his Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts as well as thinking about the wireframes before I got to coding.</p>

<p>I'm pretty confident in my next steps.  I have all of my files talking to each other which was one of my bigger challenges with the new code that we are working with this month.  The site is live via jekyll and github.  I have all the text I need.  I took photos yesterday, have a high quality logo, and am hopefully going to be receiving professional photos of the food today.  I'm going to style for mobile first and then adapt for desktop.  My biggest concern is time...there is a lot to do between this class and the other one I'm in and I will most likely have to make decisions in both classes as to where I sacrifice on my design in order to meet my deadlines.  Let's just say I ordered an 80 pack of k-cups from Amazon before this week started!</p>
