<p>I like organization.  Actually, I love organization.  So when asked to describe what my first steps are in getting my website project off the ground, I naturally started with organization.  I haven't been able to connect with my business contact yet -- I've tried emailing and calling, so the next step will be to swing by on Saturday.  So, in order to make some progress while I'm waiting to connect, I figured I get my project in order.</p>

<p>I created a new repo in GitHub.  I made a gh-pages brances.  I got Jekyll loaded into the folder.  I created a folder for the menu and contact information for my site.  And then I got stuck.  My menu page and my contact page are not loading from the live gh-pages site (but they are okay from the local server site).  I tried reading the documentation and looking at my sandbox site to try to figure out what's going on.  I purposely didn't reach out for help for about an hour or so -- I know that by struggling with this, I'll learn the guts of it better.  But alas, I gave up and asked for help.  So, I'm hoping to have this sorted out before Sunday because I would like to start designing by then.</p>

<p>On the creative side of things, in my meeting with Thomas, the business owner, I plan to chat with him about what his website goals are.  I found some good references online for web redesign checklists so I can have an outline of questions to ask.  I also plan to start a mood board if I have time before the meeting in order to see if I'm on the right path based on his current website and printed menu.  While I'm meeting with him, I'll also take some pictures of the restaurant -- the images on instagram and facebook aren't high quality and there might be copyright concerns with using them -- especially if other patrons took the pictures.</p>

<p>I'm ready to spend some quality time on this project!</p>
