<p>I set aside the last day and a half to focus on the content we've covered in class so far.  I knew terminl intimidated me, so I watched a Lynda video on that.  I no longer feel that I'm going to magically disappear into the Matrix every time I write something in the command line.<p>

<p>I also spent some time further researching SASS and made it mostly through the Lynda video, Responsive CSS with Sass and Compass with Ray Villalobos.  This course has been nice since it's reinforcing the classroom concepts while helping me develop my own template for my future projects.</p>

<p>One thing I'm super excited about is setting up a grid system.  I used to do some print work back in high school and college (in the 90's!) and I used to be an engineer, so grids make a lot of sense to me.  Previously, I had created an excel spreadsheet to do the calculations for me based on container width, margins and number of columns.  I would then hand code in the values in my css sheets based on my spreadsheet.  I'm super (!) excited to be able to create a grid system that will calculate all these things for me.  (Yes, I really am that excited.)</p>

<p>However, I am getting overwhelmed right now.  I google in a phrase related to SASS or mixins and get a whole lot of great results.  I'm trying to take in as much as I can, but there is a lot out there.  My to-do list related to this class is crazy!  I am enjoying the freedom right now to take a topic, dive in and try to understand it in a way that makes the most sense to me.</p>
