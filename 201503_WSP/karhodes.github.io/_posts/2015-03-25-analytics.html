<p>Google Analytics is a powerful tool to aid in tailoring your site based on the visitors coming to it.  Google Analytics provides data regarding who visits your site, when they visit, and to some extent how they got there.  But that's just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>Through Google, you can actually get up to 100 accounts with a single Google id to perform analytics.  Each account is linked to a specific website -- when you sign up for a new account, you get a tracking code that you then insert in the head of your website html template.</p> 

<p>There are 4 steps to using analytics, whether or not they are Google-based, Facebook-based or from another service.  The first step is the collection of the data (which happens once you have the tracking code mentioned above in your html).  The data is then tailored to your specific needs (configuration) and processed.  Finally, the data is provided via reports.</p>

<p>In reading more about from the Google Analytics home page, I came across the Experiments section.  With Experiments, you are able to test up to 10 different landing pages across specific metrics to see if those metrics you are tracking change across the landing pages.  You can even decide what percentage of the population of visitors to your site see which variation.</p>

<p>In addition to Google providing analytics, Facebook does as well, but on a smaller scale.  I'm actually the admin on a public page and after the lecture on analytics, I pulled up the analytics page for my Facebook page.  It was interesting to see that we even had an interaction with someone on the other side of the world, even though that person doesn't even "like" our page.</p>
