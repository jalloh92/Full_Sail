<p>First things first.  I'm looking forward to a full 48 hours of no classes starting at 5pm today.  I can't wait to cook, do laundry, work out, do yard work...but most importantly, I can't wait to absorb what I've learned this week.  I plan on reviewing what I've learned in between my chores!<p>

<p>That brings me to the topic of today's post:  SASS (Super Awesome cSS).  I love the idea of pre-processors.  I love the idea of creating variables for my stylesheets -- I get how that will transform my work flow into being something much more flexible than just using plain ole' vanilla css.  The partials get me especially excited -- I had already been trying to break my entire css into smaller files in my previous classes to aid in organization (because hunting and pecking through hundreds of lines of code is so much fun!) -- partials will give me the freedom to (properly) do what I had been attempting to do before.  And did I mention mixins?  Not having to type (or copy and paste) all those browser prefixes will save me time.  And time is money, right?</p>

<p>We were also introduced HTML5 boilerplate and Compass this week.  Two other awesome time-saving powerful tools for web designers and developers.  Being the nerd I am, I spent my time reading the documentation (versus just diving in) and tried some of the things mentioned in the Compass tutorial section.  I was especially excited to try the grid system!  I was able to apply a grid to the Compass site I was playing with but the documentation was not at all clear in how to adjust the variables for the grid -- more things for me to play with in my free time.</p>

<p>I'll admit that due to my class schedule this week, I didn't have as much time as I would have liked to play with my new toys (hence, this blog still has no styling).  However, I know that if I spend a little bit of time (hopefully in the next 48 hours!) getting everything set up in a template to accomodate my working style, I'll be able to quickly bang out some work.  And that's the whole point of this class -- to give us tools to aid in our workflow that save us on the more tedious steps.</p>
