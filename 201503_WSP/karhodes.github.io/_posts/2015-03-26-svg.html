<p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are simply a mathematical description of an image -- even though that sounds intimitating, it shouldn't be!  If we go back to simple geometry, we can describe a square by giving the points of it's four corners or we can describe a circle by giving the location of its center and its radius.  SVG takes these bits of information and then creates the square or circle of more complex shape...and no math is actually required from the developer!  SVG files can be created directly from an Illustrator file (save as SVG) and the geometrical information is automatically generated into a text file.</p>

<p>So, SVG's are like images, but they're more powerful.  You could use the img tag to place the SVG in your code, or you could paste the text generated from a design tool like Illustrator.  You could keep your SVGs in a sprite sheet.  You can modify the SVG properties such as color with css.  No matter what size the SVG is, it remains crisp.  Which is awesome for responsive web design.  Another bonus?  SVG file size tends to be lightweight.</p>

<p>SVG's are great for icons, but they can be used for so much more.  One feature that I'm interested in is the text element for SVG where you can add text to a graphic.  Additionally, you could add a texture filter or a lighting filter to further enhance things.  If you wanted to go really crazy, you could even write a javascript code to generate your SVG.  This is a relatively new technology so it will be interesting to see where the web goes with this!</p>
