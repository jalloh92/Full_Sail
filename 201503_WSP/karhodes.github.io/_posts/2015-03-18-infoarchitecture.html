<p>We were given the opportunity to research either Search Engine Optimization (SEO) or Information Architecture for this latest post.  I'm already a bit familiar with SEO, but not so much with Information Architecture so I decided to look into the later.</p>

<p>Information Architecture is simply how the information of a site is built and put together.  To not have information clearly organized and easily accessible will lead to user's frustrations.  The Web Style Guide has a great article that introduces the topic:  <a href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/3-information-architecture/index.html">Information Architecture</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, Shari Thurow wrote a fabulous article going into more depth explaining what Information Architecture is and isnt (<a href ="http://marketingland.com/6-information-architecture-facts-every-business-know-120921"> 6 Information Architecture Facts Every Business Show Know"</a>).  She goes as far as to state that "search engine visibility increases with a clear information architecture."</p>

<p>Another recent article I came across, <a href="http://searchcontentmanagement.techtarget.com/news/2240242346/Website-upgrades-lay-groundwork-for-customer-experience-strategy">Website upgrades lead groundwork for customer experience strategy</a> by Lauren Horwitz, further supports the need for a good Information Architecture strategy for business.  How will a customer find your business and specifically your products if that information isn't properly planned out?  Information Architecture can lead to a customized experience for your site visitor (think of Amazon's suggestions) by making those connections between various bits of data.</p>

<p>Organizing things is a passion of mine.  Everything in my home has its place, and same with the files on my laptop.  Would I make a good Information Architect?  I actually started digging into the background of the folks in this area and they tend to have a combination of psychology and library and information science.  Unfortunately, there are not any Information Architecture Institute groups in the Orlando, FL area.  Even though, I'll still try to keep up to date on this field and stay cognizant of how my school work can contribute to this area.</p>
