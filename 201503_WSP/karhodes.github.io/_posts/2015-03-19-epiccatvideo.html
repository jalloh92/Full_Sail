<p>(Disclaimer:  There are no epic cat videos in this post)</p>

<p>I sat in this morning at the Full Sail Hall of Fame session, Keep their Attention:  Optimize - and Monetize - Your Media for Today's Audience.  The panel consisted of folks from Full Sail's Internet Marketing Master's degree.  While they focused mainly on YouTube and Vimeo, they still discussed some great strategies for SEO that can be applied to other web products as well.</p>

<p>Keyword research is the art of discovering what folks type into their search bars so that you can make sure you are (appropriately) coming up in their results.  Based on my results at the <a href="http://www.googlefeud.com">Google Feud</a>, I'm not very good at predicting what folks are searching for. However, knowing the phrase "keyword research" allowed me to springboard into learning how to go about doing this.  I ran across a <a href="http://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo/keyword-research">beginner's guide to keyword research</a> on the moz site that was particularly helpful.  A big takeaway:  you want to make sure you're driving the right folks to your site.  The panel also mentioned that if you just overload on keywords on your site, Google will catch on and bump your site further down the list.</p>

<p><a href="http://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer">CoSchedule's Headline Analyzer</a> was another resource the panel mentioned.  There are certain words that tug at our heartstrings and make us more likely to click on a link.  So, for example, if someone had a blog post called "Epic Cat Video!!!", there's a greater chance of a click.  According to CoShedule, it's 33% unique and 33% emotional (but not at all powerful).  However, to title something just for the click while not bringing the content the user is looking for isn't really a great practice.  Maybe I should find an epic cat video for this post to link...</p>

<p>Finally, the last resource they mentioned was the video blog, <a href="http://www.reelseo.com">Reel SEO</a>.  While it's geared towards video SEO, there are still a lot of lessons that could be applied to other web products as well.  I'm excited that I sat in this panel -- I learned lots of things that are applicable to this week's lesson!</p>
