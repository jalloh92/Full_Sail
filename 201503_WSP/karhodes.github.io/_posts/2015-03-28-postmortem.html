<p>In looking back over this past month, one of the things that most surprised me was how quickly I was able to pull together the final project, partially because I'm getting faster at coding CSS, HTML and supporting languages but also due to the tools we learned this month.  I wish I had a little more time to work on the site to make it look polished, but overall, I'm happy with what I was able to do in a short amount of time.</p>

<p>Probably the biggest frustration this month was the amount of new information we recieved each day in class and not having the time to get very deep with each topic.  However, that was about it!  I love how the final project was structured and discussions about the industry.</p>
