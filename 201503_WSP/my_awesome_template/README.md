# template

Name:  Kelly Rhodes

This is my starting template for my web projects.  It is based upon Jekyll, SASS, Bourbon and Neat.

The posts, syntax-highlighting.scss and feed.xml have been stripped out of Jekyll.

To host a site via github, follow the steps below:

1. Create a repo on github (repoName)
2. In config.yml, change the baseurl to "/repoName" and change the url to "/repoName"
3. Create & sync to a gh-pages branch for your repo

Go to username.github.io/repoName to see your live site!

This is hosted at karhodes.github.io/my_awesome_template

To get started on updating your site:

1. Modify _config.yml as necessary
2. Place links to external fonts in _includes/head.html (use in the _fonts.scss file)
