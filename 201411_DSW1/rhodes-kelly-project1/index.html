		<h2 id = "history">History</h2>
		
		<p>According to <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-stitch">Wikipedia</a>, <q>cross-stich is the oldest form of embroidery in the world.</q>Cross-stitch is simply making patterns or images from X-shaped stitches.  After the 2009 recession, many young people became interested in crafting.  Cross-stitch that combined tongue-in-cheek sayings with traditional motifs became popular. </p>

		<h2 id = "materials">Materials</h2>
		
		<p>To create your cross-stitch work of art, you simply need fabric, thread and a needle -- all of which can be found at a local craft store.  Beginners would find using a pattern helpful.</p>
		
		<h3>Fabric</h3>
		
		<p>Aida fabric is widely used for cross-stitch projects.  Fabrics are categorized by threads per inch (referred to as 'count'), which can range from 11 to 40 count.  Aida fabric comes in a variety of colors, but usually only white, linen or black is available at your local craft store; to find the more exotic colored fabric, you will have to look online.</p>
		
		<h3>Thread</h3>
		
		<p>The thread used in cross-stitch projects is embroidery floss.  A wide range of colors is available at your local craft store.  Floss even comes in metallic or tied-dyed colors!</p>
