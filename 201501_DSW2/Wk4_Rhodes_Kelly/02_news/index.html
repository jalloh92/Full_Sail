			<h2>TEAZER to play at Ralphfest</h2>
			<p><strong>January 15th, 2015</strong> -- It's official!  TEAZER will be playing at Ralphfest 4 on Friday, February 20th at Will's Pub at the outdoor stage.  "We are excited to be back together and play again for all the pretty, pretty girls," said lead guitarist Juan Ascru.  "We are doing it for charity, and also the promise of free nachos," added drummer Holden Cheex.  Central Florida has not seen a show like this since their last gig in 2006, and the boys plan to deliver an even more epic performance.</p>
			<h2>TEAZER's Back</h2>
			<p><strong>January 2nd, 2015</strong> -- Rumors of a TEAZER reunion are true!  Since Holden's release after being held captive by Russian teenage girls for many, many years, the boys are able to get back together again!  "It just wasn't the same without Holden," said bass guitarist Phillup Youraz.  "Even though he seemed really happy to be detained by the teenage Russian girls, we're happy to have him back."  They've been rehearsing in an undisclosed location and are looking for the right opportunity to melt your faces once again.</p>
